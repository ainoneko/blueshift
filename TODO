High priority:
	Add models for calculating fade and refresh rate parameters
	Test with multiple X screens

Medium priority:
	Add a section in manual for information on which order
	  to apply settings and how it affects the result.
	Improve multi-screen and multi-display support so that new
	  connections are not need all the time.

	  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_resampling
	  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochanekâ€“Bartels_spline
	  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairstep_interpolation
	  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_interpolation
	Use curve sizes returned from RandR/VidMode/...
	  (Not too important, it is hardcoded in X to only allow 256)
	Use Robertson's method
	Screen count function for VidMode should be added
	Demo solar predictions

Future stuff:
	How is it looking on the DirectFB front?
	Make an example that warns about UPS states
	  (not too important, you should have that in /etc/inittab)
