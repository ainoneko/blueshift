High priority:
	Add support for monitor hotplugging

Medium priority:
	Demo functionise

Low priority:
	Add a section in manual for information on which order
	  to apply settings and how it affects the result.
	Document examples in info manual
	Make an example that inverts the colours when the battery is low

Future stuff:
	Add wayland support (could not find an API for it, but xwayland works)

	Test on the BSD:s
	Test on Hurd
	Add support for the BSD:s' TTY:s
	Add support for Hurd TTY
	Add reactos support (this way windows might get supported without my
	  computer or soul being violated with proprietary software.)
	Raw ramp applying functions with recalcuated interpolation, linear and
	  polynomial
	Make an example that warns about UPS states
	  (not too important, you should have that in /etc/inittab)
