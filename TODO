High priority:
	Add support for monitor hotplugging
	Add models for calculating fade and refresh rate parameters

Medium priority:
	Add a section in manual for information on which order
	  to apply settings and how it affects the result.

Low priority:
	Raw ramp applying functions with precalcuated interpolation, polynomial
	Add cie_temperature
	Add support for proxies such as Tor in weather
	Add support for temporarily closing DRM connection so that multiple users can run in DRM

Future stuff:
	Add wayland support (could not find an API for it, but xwayland works)
	Add mir support
	Add haiku support (haiku currently does not support gamma ramps)
	Test on the BSD:s
	Test on Hurd
	Add support for the BSD:s' TTY:s
	Add support for Hurd TTY
	Add reactos support (this way windows might get supported without my
	  computer or soul being violated with proprietary software.)
	Make an example that warns about UPS states
	  (not too important, you should have that in /etc/inittab)
