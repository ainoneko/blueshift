High priority:
	Add support for monitor hotplugging
	Add models for calculating fade and refresh rate parameters

Medium priority:
	Test, demo and document _ICC_PROFILE
	Demo functionise, store and restore
	Make it possible to have settings depend on sky condicitions.
	  (I have a GPL3 implmenetion of wheter observation in xpybar.)

Low priority:
	Demo cie_{brigtness,contrast,manipulate} with 3 arguments and
	  cie_limits with 6 arguments.
	Demo `None` and `...` in sigmoid, manipulate, cie_manipulate
	  and lower_resolution.
	Add a section in manual for information on which order
	  to apply settings and how it affects the result.
	Demo make_icc_interpolation

Future stuff:
	Add wayland support (could not find an API for it, but xwayland works)
	Add mir support
	Add haiku support (haiku currently does not support gamma ramps)
	Test on the BSD:s
	Test on Hurd
	Add support for the BSD:s' TTY:s
	Add support for Hurd TTY
	Add reactos support (this way windows might get supported without my
	  computer or soul being violated with proprietary software.)
	Raw ramp applying functions with recalcuated interpolation, linear and
	  polynomial
