points = solar 3 -6 ; (default)
; Adjustment settings have up to two values, one for when the Sun's
; elevation is above 3° (day) and one for when it is below −6° (night).

;points = solar -18 -12 -6 0 6
; Adjustment settings have up to five values that depend on the Sun's
; elevation: at and below −18°, at −12°, at −6°, at 0° and at and above
; 6°. Interpolation of values are used between these points to give nice
; transitions.

;points = solar -18 0 3 6 reduce
; Adjustment settings have up to two values. When the Sun's elevation is
; at or below −18° the first value is used, when it is at or above 6° the
; second value is used. Between −18° and 6° interpolation is used to give
; nice transitions: at 0° two thirds of the first value and one third of
; the second value is used, and at 3° on third of the first value and two
; thirds of the second value is used.

;point = time 6:00 10:00 20:00
; Adjustment settings have up to three values. At 6:00 the first value is
; used, at 10:00 the second value is used and at 20:00 the third value is
; used. Between 6:00 and 10:00 interpolation between first and second
; value is used, between 10:00 and 20:00 interpolation between the second
; and third valu is used, and between 20:00 and 4:00 interpolation between
; the third and first value is used.

;points = time 6:00 10:00 20:00 reduce
; Adjustment settings have up to two values. At 6:00 the first value is
; used, and at 20:00 the second setting is used. Interpolation is used
; between between 20:00 and 6:00, but between 6:00 and 20:00 interpolation
; is used with the adjustment that both the first and the second value
; is used to 50 % each at 10:00.

; For the following settings you can also add the word ‘linear’, just
; as ‘cie’ can be used on some settings. ‘linear’ (which is supported
; on all adjustments) performs the adjustments in linear RGB colour
; space. ‘cie’ (which is only supported where used in this example)
; performs the adjustments in CIE xyY colour space. ‘linear’ and ‘cie’
; can be combined but should not be combined as it has no proper meaning.
; Additional, while possible, ‘linear’ should not be used with ‘linear’,
; as that too has no proper meaning.

; All of this adjustments can have multiple values, but in this example
; only ‘temperature’ uses this. We have set “points = solar 3 -6”, which
; means that the first setting is used during the day and the second is
; used between civil dusk and civil dawn (night). The other settings
; only use one value (in this example) which means that those apply all
; day long.

; The order of adjustments are made in the order they are listed. which
; means that putting gamma before temperature produces another result
; than putting temperature before gamma. Monitor specific adjustments
; are made after these adjustments.
