X11 does not apply gamma correction, brightness, etc.
(colour curves) to the cursor. Blueshift have no effect
on the cursor. It does not seem to be possible to
listen for changes in the visible cursor and edit it.

The colour curves are strictly independent, it is
for example not possible to swap red and blue, or
a subpixel depend on another. It is to my knowledge
not possible to do so in X11.

VidMode can only modify the primary monitor.

Can only support upto 64 monitors. If you have
more please send be a photo of your awesome set
up I will make sure to fix this.
