Blueshift adjusts the colour temperature of your
monitor according to brightness outside to reduce
eye strain and make it easier to fall asleep when
going to bed. If can also be used to increase the
colour temperature and make the monitor bluer,
this helps you focus on your work.

Blueshift is inspired by Redshift but is vastly
more flexible and solves some problems with Redshift:

    - Decreases the colour temperature too early
      during the winter which can make you tired
      during daytime.

    - Limited support for settings such as
      brightness and contrast. Technologies like
      Blueshift and Redshift needs to remove all
      settings made by other programs, to be
      portable and to have get accuracy, which
      means that you cannot any other program
      at the same time. Redshift supports only
      gamman and a limited brightness range.
      Blueshift can be extended by the user to
      do anything and have built in support for
      unlimited brightness, contrast, gamma
      correction and S-curve correction.
      Brightness and contrast are normally not
      important because you should configure
      that on the monitors control panel. But
      one may want to temporarly so a change
      to contrast to increase the brightness
      beyond 100 %. Blueshift is to might
      knowledge the first program to support
      S-curve correction which is important
      for LCD monitors which suffers the effects
      of S-curves.
